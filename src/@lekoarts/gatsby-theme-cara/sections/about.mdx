## About Me

I did a lot of project since last year and I feels like it's very intersting to do and it also improve my programming skill as well. The first time I learned web programming in serious way is when my friend suggest me to try a free basic web course from Dicoding and it was realy amazing. I learned a lot from that course and then I started to learn more, more and more. And now being a developer is becoming my dream job until I could build my own IT Company.
